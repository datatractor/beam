Documentation of Datatractor Beam, the reference implementation of the Datatractor API,
published at `Datatractor Yard <https://yard.datatractors.org/>`_.

Datatractor :mod:`beam` is a draft Python 3.10 package, which can be used to:
- query the registry of `Extractors <https://yard.datatractor.org/extractors/>`_ for extractors that support a given file type,
- install those extractors in a fresh Python virtual environment environment via `pip`,
- invoke the extractor either in Python or at the CLI, producing Python objects or files on disk.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:datatractor/beam.git
   cd beam
   pip install .

Usage
-----

Currently, you can use the ``extract`` function from the :mod:`beam` module inside your own Python code:

.. code-block:: python

   from beam import extract

   # extract(<input_type>, <input_path>)
   data = extract("./example.mpr",  "biologic-mpr")

This example will install the first compatible ``biologic-mpr`` extractor it finds in the registry into a fresh virtualenv, and then execute it on the file at ``example.mpr``.

By default, the ``extract`` function will attempt to use the extractor's Python-based invocation (i.e. the optional ``preferred_mode="python"`` argument is specified). This means the extractor will be executed from within python, and the returned ``data`` object will be a Python object as defined (and supported) by the extractor. This may require additional packages to be installed, for examples ``pandas`` or ``xarray``, which are both supported via the installation command ``pip install .[formats]`` above. If you encounter the following traceback, a missing "format" (such as ``xarray`` here) is the likely reason:

.. code-block:: python

   Traceback (most recent call last):
       [...]
       data = pickle.loads(shm.buf)
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xarray'

Alternatively, if the ``preferred_mode="cli"`` argument is specified, the extractor will be executed using its command-line invocation. This means the output of the extractor will most likely be a file, which can be further specified using the ``output_type`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

   from beam import extract
   ret = extract("example.mpr", "biologic-mpr", output_path="output.nc", preferred_mode = "cli")

In this case, the ``ret`` will be empty bytes, and the output of the extractor should appear in the ``output.nc`` file.
